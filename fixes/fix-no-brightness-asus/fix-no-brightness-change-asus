If you can't turn brightness up and down try the following:

Check that you can use command `backlight -dec 50` 

If not, see if xorg-xbacklight is installed. If not try installing it.



If you cannot see changes, do the following.

Go to `/sys/class/backlight` and check that `intel_backlight` folder exist.
  If it does, do the following:
    * Create file /etc/X11/xorg.conf with the following content:


```

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Intel Graphics" 
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
EndSection


```

and then logout and try again.
