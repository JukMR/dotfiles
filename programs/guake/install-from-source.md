## Install from source
If you want to install Guake from its sources, please follow this procedure:

First, DO NOT USE TARBALLS GENERATED BY GITHUB on the Release Page. They are automatically generated and cannot be used alone. We use a package, namely PBR, that requires the full git history to work.

Checkout the HEAD of the source tree with:

$ git clone https://github.com/Guake/guake.git
make sure that you have the needed system dependencies (Python GTK, VTE, â€¦) installed for your system. If you are unsure about the dependencies, you can run this script to install them:

$ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-[debian, arch, fedora].sh run make
Note: Insert your distribution in the square brackets.

## To install Guake itself, use:

$ make
$ sudo make install
To uninstall, still in the source directory:

$ make
$ sudo make uninstall

## Tips for a complete Guake reinstallation (without system dependencies):

$ sudo make uninstall && make && sudo make install
$ # Or use this shortcut:
$ make reinstall  # (do not sudo it!)
